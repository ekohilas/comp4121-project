# Contextual Text Prediction using Hidden Markov Models
## Evan Kohilas

### Abstract
General text prediction is often done through analysis of paired words,
where suggested words are those which are most commonly used or followed.
While these models can be useful in predicting a sender's text, they often
lack understanding in the context of the receiver in a conversation. In this
paper, we explore the different usages of Hidden Markov Models where we
attempt to predict a sender's next word from the predicted states given the
sender's current input as the observed states.
